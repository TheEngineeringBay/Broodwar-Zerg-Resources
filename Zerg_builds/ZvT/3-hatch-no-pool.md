### General information

**Approximate Date:** 2018-Oct-27

**Map:**: Circuit Breaker 

**Player:** Effort  

**Pregame notes:**: The following build takes early game risks to gain a mid game economic advantage 

**Backing theory:**: Against the 1-1-1 terran meta on large 4 player maps, terran sacrifice the ability to punish early economic greed by favoring quickly teching. This allows zerg players to aggressively pursue initial economy in the form of an early 3rd macro hatch before pool. By following up with burrow and zergling speed, a zerg player can force a terran into an early defensive position allowing the zerg player to inflict economic damage and stunt early vulture harassment. This also allows a zerg player to safely tech and transition into a strong mid game position.
