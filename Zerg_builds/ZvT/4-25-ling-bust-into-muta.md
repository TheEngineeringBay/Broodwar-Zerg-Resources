### General information

**Approximate Date:** 2018-Sept-02

**Player:** Effort  

**Pregame notes:** This build is an all-in build. Its success relies on your opponent's inability to scout or properly respond. 

**Backing theory:** By getting the extractor immediately after the hatchery it allows you to get metabolic boost and a lair simultaneously. If your opponent scouted late, or doesn't have a good understanding of build orders they may think you just went lair first and speed later, or no speed at all. If you can kill their scout (especially before speed finishes), you can surprise them with a flood of speed lings.|
The window to attack is small. If your opponent goes 1-1-1 or 10-10-10 you really want to attack before ion thrusters or spider mines finish upgrading, so attack between 4:00-4:25
