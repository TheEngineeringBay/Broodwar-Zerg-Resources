### General information

**Approximate Date:** 

**Player:** 

**Pregame notes:**  This build is an all-in build. Its success relies on your opponent's inability to scout or properly respond. 

**Backing theory:**

This build exploits a protoss who is teching while relying on their building placement at their natural to repel attacks.
