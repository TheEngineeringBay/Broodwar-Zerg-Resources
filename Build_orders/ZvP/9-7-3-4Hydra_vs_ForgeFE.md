### General information

**Approximate Date:** 2020-Aug-13

**Player:** Zero (Queen)

**Pregame notes:** On 2 player maps: you do not need a drone scout

**Backing theory:**
The 9734 build creates a powerful hydra timing attack around the 5:30 mark. It is difficult for a protoss opponent to respond.
If the protoss under commits with cannons they lose outright. If they over commit they often put themselves in a difficult economic position to deal with follow up hydra pushes.
