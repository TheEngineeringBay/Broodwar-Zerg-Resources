### General information

**Approximate Date:** 2018-Oct-27

**Map:**: Transistor

**Player:** Effort  

**Pregame notes:**: As of 2020-10-19 2 hatch muta is considered the standard safe meta opening against Terran. Small adjustments and responses to terran openings allow theorhetical transition into a standard late macro game (defiler/ling/lurker --> defiler/ulralisk)
 
**Backing theory:** 2 hatch muta forces an initial missile turret investment from bio based terran and prevents them from taking an early 3rd. 5 mutalisks also allow SCV/economic harass followed by unit movement harassment across the map. The general objective is to slow a terran's economy down and keep their marine and medic count low. This allows a transition into, drone saturation, lurkers, a 3rd base and in optimal situations defilers depending on the success of the mutalisk harass. It is best to abandon mutalisk production when an opposing terran has produced a science vessel and has irradiate available. Scourge attacks on unprotected science vessels can extend terran vulnerabilty to mutalilsk harassment.
